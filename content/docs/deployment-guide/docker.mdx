description: Deploy Motia applications using Docker containers

<Callout title="Coming Soon" type="warn">
  Docker deployment documentation is under active development. This page will be updated with complete instructions for containerizing and deploying Motia applications with Docker.
</Callout>

## What to Expect

The Docker deployment guide will cover:

- **Dockerfile setup** for Motia projects with the iii engine
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized production images
- **Docker Compose** configurations for local development with Redis and other services
- **Environment configuration** for production containers
- **Health checks** and container orchestration best practices

## Current Alternative

For self-hosted deployments, see the [Self-Hosted guide](/docs/deployment-guide/self-hosted) which covers deploying Motia projects using existing container tooling.

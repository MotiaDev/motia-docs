# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Motia CLI handles project scaffolding and deployment. It is installed with the `motia` package.

<Callout type="info">
During development, `npm run dev` starts the [iii](https://iii.dev) runtime which orchestrates building and running your Motia application. The commands below are either run directly by you or internally by iii's Shell Exec module.
</Callout>

---

## Build

### `motia build`

Build your project, generating an optimized bundle for production.

```bash
npx motia build
```

Your iii config.yaml should have the following ExecModule config for TypesScript:

```yaml
  - class: modules::shell::ExecModule
    config:
      exec:
        - bun run --enable-source-maps index-production.js
```

description: Learn how to use the Motia CLI and the iii engine CLI to build, develop, and run your application
---

Motia projects use two CLIs: the **Motia CLI** for building and scaffolding your application, and the **iii CLI** for running the engine that powers everything.

---

## iii CLI

The iii engine is the runtime that manages all infrastructure modules (queues, state, streams, cron, HTTP) and your Motia application process.

### Install iii

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

### `iii`

Start the iii engine. By default it looks for `config.yaml` in the current directory.

```bash
iii
```

### `iii -c <config-file>`

Start the engine with a specific configuration file.

```bash
iii -c config.yaml
iii -c config-production.yaml
```

### `iii -v`

Print the iii engine version.

```bash
iii -v
```

<Callout type="info">
During development, your `package.json` should have `"dev": "iii"` so that `npm run dev` starts the engine, which reads `config.yaml` and boots all configured modules including your Motia application via the ExecModule.
</Callout>

## iii Console

The iii console provides a visual interface for building and debugging flows. Install and run it separately:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/console/main/install.sh | sh
iii-console --enable-flow
```

Then open [http://localhost:3113/](http://localhost:3113/) to see flow diagrams, real-time logs, state inspection, and stream monitoring.

## Motia CLI

The Motia CLI is installed with the `motia` npm package and handles building, scaffolding, and managing your application code.

### `motia create`

Scaffold a new Motia project with sensible defaults including `config.yaml`, `package.json`, and example Steps.

```bash
npx motia@latest create
```

### `motia build`

Build your project, generating an optimized production bundle in `dist/`.

```bash
npx motia build
```

This produces:
- `dist/index-production.js`
- `dist/index-production.js.map`

Your `config.yaml` should reference the production bundle in the ExecModule (place this under the top-level `modules:` list):

```yaml title="config.yaml (production ExecModule)"
modules:
  # ... other modules (StreamModule, StateModule, etc.) ...

  - class: modules::shell::ExecModule
    config:
      exec:
        - bun run --enable-source-maps dist/index-production.js
```

### `motia dev`

Start the Motia SDK in development mode. This is typically run automatically by the iii engine's ExecModule, not manually.

```bash
npx motia dev
```

Your `config.yaml` ExecModule for development (place this under the top-level `modules:` list). The `watch` array defines file patterns that trigger a rebuild, and the `exec` commands run sequentially — `npx motia dev` compiles the Steps, then `node dist/index-dev.js` starts the built output:

```yaml title="config.yaml (development ExecModule)"
modules:
  # ... other modules (StreamModule, StateModule, etc.) ...

  - class: modules::shell::ExecModule
    config:
      watch:
        - steps/**/*.ts
      exec:
        - npx motia dev
        - node dist/index-dev.js
```

### `motia rules pull`

Update AI development guides (Cursor rules, AGENTS.md) to the latest version.

```bash
npx motia rules pull
npx motia rules pull --force  # Overwrite existing
```

---

## Typical Development Workflow

```bash
npx motia@latest create      # Scaffold a new project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev                    # Runs `iii` which starts everything
```

The `iii` engine reads `config.yaml`, starts all modules, and uses the ExecModule to build and run your Motia Steps automatically. File changes trigger hot-reload.

title: Adapters Overview
description: Introduction to Motia's adapter system for pluggable infrastructure
---

Adapters are the infrastructure layer of Motia. They abstract storage, event handling, streams, and cron locking so you can swap implementations without changing your application code.

## What Are Adapters?

Adapters implement interfaces that Motia uses for core infrastructure operations:

- **State Adapter** → Persistent key-value storage
- **Stream Adapter** → Real-time data streams
- **Event Adapter** → Event-based communication
- **Cron Adapter** → Distributed cron job locking

## Why Adapters Matter

### Single Instance (Default)

By default, Motia uses file-based and in-memory adapters perfect for single-instance deployments:

- State stored in `.motia/motia.state.json`
- Streams stored in `.motia/streams/`
- Events in process memory
- Cron locking in process memory

<Callout type="info">
Default adapters work great for development, testing, and single-instance production deployments. No configuration needed!
</Callout>

### Multiple Instances (Distributed)

When you run multiple Motia instances, you need distributed adapters:

- **Shared state** across instances
- **Distributed events** so all instances can process them
- **Real-time streams** synchronized across instances
- **Distributed cron locking** to prevent duplicate executions

<Callout type="warn">
Without distributed adapters, each Motia instance has isolated state and events. Use Redis or RabbitMQ adapters for multi-instance deployments.
</Callout>

## Adapter Architecture

Adapters follow a clean interface pattern:

1. **Interfaces** define contracts in `@motiadev/core`
2. **Implementations** satisfy these contracts
3. **Composition** - adapters are injected, not extended

This design provides:
- ✅ Easy swapping of implementations
- ✅ Type safety with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Testability with in-memory adapters
- ✅ Extensibility for custom backends

## Quick Example

**Default (no config):**
```typescript
// Uses FileStateAdapter, FileStreamAdapter, etc.
export default config({})
```

**With Redis:**
```typescript
import { RedisStateAdapter } from '@motiadev/adapter-redis-state'

export default config({
  adapters: {
    state: new RedisStateAdapter({ host: 'localhost', port: 6379 })
  }
})
```

**Your code stays the same:**
```typescript
// Works with both file and Redis adapters
await state.set('orders', 'order-123', { id: 'order-123' })
```

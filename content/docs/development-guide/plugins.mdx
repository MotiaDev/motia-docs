import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="error">
**Plugins have been removed from motia and the workbench.** The plugin system that was previously available for extending the workbench UI and adding custom functionality is no longer supported.
</Callout>

## What Changed

In previous versions, you could create and install plugins to extend motia's workbench with custom tabs, visualizations, and service integrations. This plugin system has been removed.

The following are no longer available:
- `MotiaPlugin` type and plugin architecture
- `WorkbenchPlugin` configuration for custom tabs
- `MotiaPluginContext` for accessing internal APIs
- Plugin CLI generation (`pnpm dlx motia create --plugin`)
- Local plugins with `~/` package resolution
- Plugin registration in `motia.config.ts`

## Migration

If you were previously using plugins, you will need to find alternative approaches for the functionality they provided. Custom API endpoints can be created as regular Steps instead.

**Motia** is a unified backend framework that combines APIs, background jobs, workflows, AI agents, streaming, and observability into a single runtime. Instead of juggling separate frameworks and services, everything is built around one core primitive: the **Step**.

A Step is just a file with a `config` and a `handler`. Motia auto-discovers these files from your project and connects them automatically — no manual registration, no boilerplate wiring.

<Callout title="The Paradigm Shift" type="info">
  React revolutionized the frontend with Components. Motia does the same for the backend with Steps — a single primitive that replaces the need for separate API frameworks, queue systems, cron schedulers, and workflow engines.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

The best way to understand Motia is to try it:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** is required

<Callout title="iii Development Console" type="info">
  Motia uses the iii development console for local development and debugging. Install iii by following the instructions at [iii.dev/docs](https://iii.dev/docs).
</Callout>

### Create a project

```bash
npx motia@latest create
```

The installer will guide you through setting up your project, including choosing a template.

### Verify

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm run dev
```

This starts the Motia runtime and the iii development console at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

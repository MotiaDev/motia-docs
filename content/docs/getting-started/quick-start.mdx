title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with a new Motia project in just a few seconds.
---

Motia is a unified backend framework where everything is a **Step** — a file with a config and a handler. In this guide you will clone an example project, start it with the iii engine, and trigger your first workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Git** installed
- **Node.js path**: Node.js 18+
- **Python path**: Python 3+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Install iii

The iii engine is the runtime that powers Motia. Install it with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
iii -v
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Clone and Install

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'Python']}>
  <Tab value="Node.js">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia-iii-example.git
cd motia-iii-example/nodejs
npm install
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia-iii-example.git
cd motia-iii-example/python
uv sync
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Start the Project

The `config.yaml` in the project tells the iii engine how to run Motia — starting iii starts everything.

```bash
iii -c iii-config.yaml
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 4. Run Your First Flow

This example is a ticketing system for user issues. Try it out:

```bash
# Create a ticket
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Login issue","description":"User is having trouble creating an account","priority":"high","customerEmail":"user@example.com"}' | jq
```

```bash
# List all tickets
curl http://localhost:3111/tickets | jq
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 5. What Just Happened?

When you created a ticket, here is what Motia did behind the scenes:

1. **HTTP trigger** — The `POST /tickets` request hit a Step with an `http` trigger, which validated the input and stored the ticket in state.
2. **Queue trigger** — That Step enqueued a message to a topic. Another Step with a `queue` trigger picked it up and processed the ticket asynchronously (e.g., classification, notification).
3. **State** — The ticket data was persisted using Motia's built-in key-value state, so the `GET /tickets` endpoint could retrieve it.

All of this was defined in simple Step files inside the `src/` folder. No manual wiring, no separate queue infrastructure — just files that Motia auto-discovered and connected.

</Step>

<Step>
### 6. Read the Code

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'Python']}>
  <Tab value="Node.js">

Open the `src/` folder to see the Step files. Each one uses the `.step.ts` pattern and exports a `config` (defining triggers and topics) and a `handler` (business logic). The `config.yaml` describes the infrastructure modules that iii sets up to power Motia.

  <Tab value="Python">

Open the `steps/` folder to see the Step files. Each one uses the `_step.py` pattern, defines a `config` dict (triggers and topics), and an `async def handler` (business logic). The `config.yaml` describes the infrastructure modules that iii sets up to power Motia.

<Step>
### 7. Try the iii Console

<Callout title="iii is in alpha" type="warn">
  Motia and iii are under very active development. We will be regularly updating Motia, iii, and the iii console to address any issues.
</Callout>

The iii console gives you complete observability of your Motia project — flow diagrams, real-time logs, state inspection, and stream monitoring. Install and start it in a new terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/console/main/install.sh | sh
iii-console --enable-flow
```

Then open your browser to: [http://localhost:3113/](http://localhost:3113/)

The console dashboard gives you a system overview of your running application:

Navigate to the **Flow** tab to see your Steps connected as a visual workflow:

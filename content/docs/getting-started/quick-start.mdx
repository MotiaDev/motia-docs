title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with a new Motia project in just a few seconds.
---

<Callout title="Start with a template" type="info">
Make sure to install iii (https://iii.dev/docs) and create a new project\
with `git clone git@github.com:MotiaDev/motia-iii-example.git` before proceeding.
</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Start the project

Navigate into your new project directory and start iii. The `config.yaml` in the project folder tells iii how to run Motia so starting iii starts both!

```bash
cd motia-iii-example 
npm install
iii -c iii-config.yaml
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Run Your First Flow

This example is a ticketing system for user issues. Try it out:
```bash
# Create a ticket
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Login issue","description":"User is having trouble creating an account","priority":"high","customerEmail":"user@example.com"}' | jq
```
```bash
# List all tickets
curl http://localhost:3111/tickets | jq
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Read the code

The application code is in the `src/` folder and `iii-config.yaml` describes the infrastructure that iii sets up to power Motia.

</Step>

### 4. Try the iii Console

<Callout title="iii is in alpha" type="warn">
  Motia and iii are under very active development. We will be regularly updating Motia, iii, and iii console to address any issues.
</Callout>

Motia now works with iii's web console and provides complete observability of Motia projects running on a iii daemon.
Install and start it in a new terminal window with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/console/main/install.sh | sh
iii-console --enable-flow
```

Then open your web browser to: http://localhost:3113/

<Step>

title: Welcome to Motia
description: "Build production-grade backends with a single primitive. APIs, background jobs, Queues, Workflows, and AI agents - unified in one system with built-in State management, Streaming, and Observability."
---

**Motia** is a unified backend framework that combines APIs, background jobs, workflows, AI agents, streaming, and observability into a single runtime. Instead of juggling separate frameworks and services, everything is built around one core primitive: the **Step**.

A Step is just a file with a `config` and a `handler`. Motia auto-discovers these files from your project and connects them automatically — no manual registration, no boilerplate wiring.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand Motia is to try it:

### Prerequisites

- **iii** is required
- **Node.js 18+** is required
- **Python 3** is optional

<Callout title="iii" type="info">
  Motia is powered by iii. Install iii by following the instructions at [iii.dev/docs](https://iii.dev/docs).
</Callout>

### Clone the example project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MotiaDev/motia-iii-example.git
```

<Callout title="Motia powered by iii is in alpha" type="info">
We will have a tool dedicated to creating motia projects soon.
</Callout>
